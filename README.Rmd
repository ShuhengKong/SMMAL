# SMMAL

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

SMMAL is an R package for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using semi-supervised learning (SSL), tailored for settings with limited treatment/outcome labels but rich covariates and surrogate variables. It enhances efficiency and robustness over supervised methods by leveraging unlabeled data and supports high-dimensional models via cross-fitting, flexible model fitting, and adaptive LASSO.


## Installation

A github version can be found at this link: https://github.com/ShuhengKong/SMMAL

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SMMAL)

# Load the example dataset included with the package
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "sample_data.rds", package = "SMMAL")
dat <- readRDS(file_path)

# Estimate ATE using the SMMAL pipeline
output <- SMMAL(
  N = 1000,
  Y = dat$Y,
  A = dat$A,
  S = data.frame(dat$S),
  X = data.frame(dat$X),
  K = 5,
  top_n = 5,
  cf_model = "bspline"
)

# View the results
print(output)

```

Description: Provides a pipeline for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) using 
    semi-supervised learning methods. Includes variable selection via LASSO, flexible outcome 
    modeling using cross-fitting with options such as xgboost, random forest, and B-splines, 
    and a doubly robust ATE estimation using both labeled and unlabeled data. Includes 
    vignette-based documentation.

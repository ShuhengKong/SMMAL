Description: 
    Provides a pipeline for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) using 
    semi-supervised learning methods. Includes variable selection via LASSO, flexible outcome 
    modeling using cross-fitting with options such as XGBoost, random forest, and B-splines, 
    and doubly robust ATE estimation leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. Vignette-based 
    documentation is included.

Description: Provides a pipeline for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) via semi-supervised learning (Hou et al. 2023). Outcome regression is fit with cross-fitting using XGBoost (Chen & Guestrin 2016), random forests (Breiman 2001), or B-splines (de Boor 1978). Doubly robust ATE estimation leverages both labeled and unlabeled data under a semi-supervised missing-data framework (Bang & Robins 2005). A detailed vignette is included.

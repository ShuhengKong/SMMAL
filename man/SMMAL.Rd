\title{Estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) via Semi-Supervised Pipeline}
\usage{
SMMAL(Y, A, S, X, nfold = 5, cf_model = "bspline")
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric vector. Observed outcomes (may include NAs for unlabelled data).}

\item{A}{Numeric vector. Treatment indicator (1 for treated, 0 for control; may include NAs).}

\item{S}{Matrix or data frame. Surrogate used only in imputation.}

\item{X}{Matrix or data frame. Main covariates used for outcome and propensity modeling.}

\item{nfold}{Integer. Number of cross-validation folds. Default is 5.}

\item{cf_model}{Character. The modeling method to use in cross-fitting.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{est}{Estimated Average Treatment Effect (ATE).}
\item{se}{Standard error of the ATE estimate.}
}
}
\description{
Executes the full ATE estimation pipeline using a semi-supervised learning approach.
This includes cross-validation fold assignment, model fitting using a chosen learner (e.g., xgboost),
and doubly robust ATE estimation using both labelled and unlabelled data.
